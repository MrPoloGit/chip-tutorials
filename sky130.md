# What is the Google/Skywater 130nm Open-Source PDK?

The Google/Skywater PDK is an open-source, manufacturable process design kit
for the Skywater 130nm process technology. Starting in 2020, Google convinced
Skywater to open-source the entire PDK and has since done 8 Multi-Project Wafer
(MPW) runs to manufacturing chips for anyone in the community. **For free.**

There were several videos as a part of the [FOSSi
Dial-up](https://www.fossi-foundation.org/dial-up/) series throughout
2020/2021:
