# STA Timing Constraints

The industry-standard method of specifying STA timing constraints is the
Synopsys Design Constraints (SDC) format. This is a text file that specifies
the timing requirements for the design. The constraints are used by the
synthesis and place-and-route tools to optimize the design for the desired
performance. This is used in tools like Design Compiler, ICC, and PrimeTime as
well as OpenROAD and OpenLane.

## Input constraints

## Output constraints

## Clocks

## Timing Exceptions

`set_false_path`
`set_multi_cycle_path`

## Ideal vs propagated clocks

`set_propagated_clock`
